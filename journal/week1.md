# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

* watched the technical help video
* watched the grading homework summaries video
  * learned a lot about Andrew's marking style
* watched the week one live stream last Saturday
* discovered how to commit and push code from gitpod to my git repo
  * I had to grant an extra permission to gitpod for the write permission
* watched Chirag's video on spending considerations
* watched Ashish's video on container security
* watched Andrew's video on Dockerfiles, docker compose, openAI documentation
* added the notifications api endpoint and the front end link
  * bug or not, I noticed that ShowActivity should have been ShowActivities, but I haven't tested this. Just an inconsistency.
* ensured that I was able to install dynamoDB and PostGres
