  * https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/tree/week-5-again-again
  * Incredibly hard to follow.
* Updating a Message Group using DynamoDB Streams https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGnzM_YdMJU

  * Followed along, but I did not create the DynamoDB on production in fear of financial costs. I will do so later when I need to.
  * I created the lambda and gave it full permissions.
