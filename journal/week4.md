# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

* watched Ashish's video on RDS security considerations and finished the quiz related to it
* watched the two-hour Saturday live stream and completed the same activites with Andrew with all the postgres scripts
* watched the video where Andrew installed PostGres drivers in the backend application
* connected Gitpod to the RDS instance
  * I followed the steps exactly regarding the VPC and security groups (wow, that was rough)
  * the script that automatically updates the IP address is cool!
* watched the video where Andrew created Cognito triggers to insert the user into the database
* watched the video where POSTing to activites saved it to the db

Scratch pad of notes, so I don't forget
