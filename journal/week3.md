# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication
* watched Ashish's video on decentralized authentication
* watched the videos on custom sign-up page, custom confirmation page, custom recovery page. I was able to successfully implement all features
  * I noticed that my logout button didn't work as intended
* watched the video on different approaches to verifying JWTs
